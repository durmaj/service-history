# service-history
online car service history and appointments 

A simple app to manage cars and their service history. 

Each user can register and make a list of his cars with details (it's private, nobody else can see it):
-brand,
-model,
-VIN number,
-Registration plates number.

For each car there is a virtual "service book" where user can upload any service entry:
-detailed description,
-cost,
-car mileage,
-date of service,
-user comments.

The complete service history view can be exported to the PDF file.

I'm planning to connect the database with the application installed on PC in the car service, so service entries would be uploaded 
automatically for customers.
